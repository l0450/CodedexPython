# Codedex Python Course repo #

This repository is made for myself to learn and understand **Python** better.
I am using this website: https://www.codedex.io/python for this reason.
Below I will explain what tasks and exercises I have done.

----

## Chapter 1 ##

### 01. Setting up ###

Copying and pasting a single line of code that prints a message. Making sure
that when the code runs, the message appears on our terminal.

### 02. Hello World ###

Same as the exercise above, but the different message is being displayed.

### 03. Pattern ###

Creating a simple triangle pattern made with numbers and spaces. Multiple
print() methods required.

### 04. Initials ###

Displaying our initials with block letters. A single line comment has been added
to say a fun fact about the person holding those initials.

### 05. Snail Mail ###

A small letter with multiple print methods that says our goal after completing this course.

## Chapter 2 ##

### 06. Data types ###

Initializing 4 variables, each one with a different data type. Below I present the data
types I used:

- **String**
- **Integer**
- **Float**
- **Boolean**

### 07. Temperature ###

Simple temperature converter. The program converts the assigned temperature value from
Fahrenheit to Celcius (based on the formula for this purpose). After this, the result
is being printed out.

### 08. BMI ###

Similar to the previous example, I assigned both values (weight and height) by myself.
Based on those values, the program calculates the user's BMI. The body mass index (BMI) was created by a Belgian mathematician in the 1850s and it's used by health and nutrition professionals to quickly estimate body fat in certain populations. The formula is pretty simple: Take an individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing it by their height in meters, squared.

### 09. Pythagorean Theorem ###

A **Pythagorean Theorem**  is the relationship between the three sides of a right triangle. It was named after the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, born around 570 BC. The program for this takes 3 values:

- The **a** which is the length of a short side.
- The **b** which is the length of another short side.
- The **c** which is the length of the hypotenuse.

The hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangle. Program asks  the user for two numbers, a and b, and then calculates the hypotenuse c.

### 10. Currency ###

We just got home from a fun trip to South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. There's some leftover cash in:

- Colombian pesos
- Peruvian soles
- Brazilian reais

A program asks the user for the amount they have in pesos, soles, and reais and calculates the total in USD.

## Chapter 3 ##

### 11. Coin Flip ###

All you need to know is that this program simulates a coin toss:

- 50% of the time, it's "Heads".
- 50% of the time, it's "Tails".

Run the program 5 times to get a taste of the if/else statement!

### 12. Grades ###

This program checks whether a grade is above or below the required exam result which is 55.
It starts by creating a variable called grade and give it a value between 0-100. Then I 
created a if/else statement that checks the result and prints out the message whether the
user passed the exam or not.

### 13. pH Levels ###

In chemistry, pH is a scale used to specify the acidity or basicity of a liquid. This piece
of code checks whether a pH level is basic, acidic, or neutral. First, a ph variable was
created and after that it asks the user for a value between 0 and 14:

- If ph is greater than 7, output "Basic".
- If ph is less than 7, output "Acidic".
- Else, output "Neutral".

### 14. Magic 8 Ball ###

The Magic 8 Ball is a popular office toy and children's toy invented in the 1940s for fortune-telling and advice seeking. It's an oversized 8 ball with some of the following answers:

- **Yes - definitely.**
- **It is decidedly so.**
- **Without a doubt.**
- **Reply hazy, try again.**
- **Ask again later.**
- **Better not tell you now.**
- **My sources say no.**
- **Outlook not so good.**
- **Very doubtful.**

An easy program  that can respond to any Yes or No questions with a different answer each time it executes.

### 15. The Cyclone ###

Since 1927, "The Cyclone" roller coaster has delighted visitors at Coney Island (Brooklyn, NY).
They're now installing a new entry system (the height requirement is 137 cm and the cost is 10 credits) and I needed your help writing the program for it! The program asks the user what their height is and how many credits they have, and store the values in a **height** variable and a **credits** variable.
Below I present the rules about what are the requirements to use this roller coaster:

- If they are tall enough and have enough credits, print "Enjoy the ride!"
- Else if they have enough credits, but they aren't tall enough, print "You are not tall enough to ride"
- Else if they are tall enough, but they don't have enough credits, print "You don't have enough credits."
- Else, print a message saying they have not met either requirement.

### 16. Sorting Hat ###

The Sorting Hat is a magical talking hat at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The hat decides which of the four "Houses" each first-year student goes to:

- **Gryffindor**
- **Slytherin**
- **Hufflepuff**
- **Ravenclaw**

The Sorting Hat asks the user some questions with the int() and input() functions. Based on the answers, the program selects the house you will represent at Hogwarts!

## Chapter 4 ##

### 17. Enter PIN ###

Copying and pasting the code that was provided in the exercise. In the terminal I put different combinations of numbers to check the result of the provided program.

### 18. Guess Number ###

It's a number guessing name, but there is a limit to the number of tries.

### 19. Detention ###

Suppose you got detention and the teacher wants you to write "I will not use Snapchat in class" on the whiteboard 100 times. I wrote this exercise using **for** loop.

### 20. 99 Bottles ###

"99 Bottles of Beer" is an old song that annoying kids, oops I mean everyone, sang on road trips to pass the time. The same as in the previous exercise, I used the for loop to print
out all the verses of "99 Bottles of Beer."

### 21. Fizz Buzz ###

Fizz Buzz is a children's word game that teaches division. It's also a classic technical interview question at countless companies. The program outputs the numbers from 1 to 100,
but here is the catch:

- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

## Control flow challenges ##

### Food ratings ###

In a five-star restaurant review system, the stars typically represent the different levels of satisfaction.

But what does each of the stars mean?

Start by creating a rating variable and set it equal to a decimal number.

Make a rating system using an if/elif/else statement:

- Rating greater than 4.5, print 'Extraordinary'
- Rating greater than 4, print 'Excellent'
- Rating greater than 3, print 'Good'
- Rating greater than 2, print 'Fair'
- Everything else, print 'Poor'

### High School Grades ###

U.S. high schools typically last for four years, from freshman year to senior year.

First, ask the user to enter their grade as an integer.

Create a four-year high school grade system using an if/elif/else statement:

- Grade is 9, print 'Freshman'
- Grade is 10, print 'Sophomore'
- Grade is 11, print 'Junior'
- Grade is 12, print 'Senior'
- Everything else is 'TBD'

### Snapple Facts ###

Snapple is a famous tea drink brand from Queens, New York. Each bottle cap comes with a silly fun fact.

Use the random module to create a number from 0 to 5.

Then use an if/elif/else statement to print out one of these six random Snapple facts:

- 0 - 'Flamingos turn pink from eating shrimp.'
- 1 - 'The only food that doesn\'t spoil is honey.'
- 2 - 'Shrimp can only swim backwards.'
- 3 - 'A taste bud\'s life span is about 10 days.'
- 4 - 'It is impossible to sneeze while sleeping.'
- 5 - 'It is illegal to sing off-key in North Carolina.'

### Seasons of the Year ###

Ah, the four seasons in the year ‚Äî winter, spring, summer, or fall; all you have to do is call!

Ask the user the month number using the input() function.

Check for the four seasons using an if/elif/else statement and logical operators:

- Month is 1, 2, 3, print 'Winter üå®Ô∏è'
- Month is 4, 5, 6, print 'Spring üå±'
- Month is 7, 8, 9, print 'Summer üåª'
- Month is 10, 11, 12, print 'Autumn üçÇ'
- Everything else is 'Invalid'

### Planet Weights ###

The year is 2199... we have become an interplanetary species and can travel to other planets in the solar system! üöÄ

Create a weight conversion program that:

- Asks the user what their Earth weight is (as a float).
- Asks the user for a planet number (as an int).

Then, use an if/elif/else statement to calculate the user's weight on the destination planet.

To calculate the user's weight:

destination weight= Earth weight √ó relative gravity

If the user enters a planet number outside of 1 - 7, print a message that says 'Invalid planet number'.

## Loops challenges ##

### Are we there yet? ###

‚ÄúAre we there yet?‚Äù is a phrase that has existed for as long as there are children, vehicles, and road trips. First, the program asks the user ‚ÄúAre we there yet?‚Äù using the input() function and stores it in an answer variable. Then, a while loop was created that asks the user ‚ÄúAre we there yet?‚Äù again. It keeps asking them this over and over until they respond with ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.

### New Year Countdown ###

Ring in the New Year! A New Year's Eve party doesn't feel complete without a countdown from 10 to 1. I used the for loop that counts down by using the "step" value in range(). Inside the loop, it prints the numbers from 10 to 1, each on its own line. When the loop finishes the countdown, print this exact string "Happy New Year! ü•≥".

### Snake Eyes ###

Suppose we have a pair of dice. In dice games, "snake eyes" means rolling two 1s. Why is it called that? Because two small dots look like a pair of snake eyes. It‚Äôs the lowest possible roll (1 + 1 = 2) and is seen as bad luck. Let's keep rerolling two dice until we get snake eyes.

### Asterisks ###

Use only a for loop with range() and print() to display a staircase of asterisks. Be sure you start with a single * in the first line and end with 24 total asterisks on the last line.

### Sum of Squares ###

A number is "squared" when it is either multiplied by itself or taken to the second power (e.g., 4¬≤ = 4 x 4 = 16).

First, ask the user for an integer with int(input()) and store it in a number variable. Then, define a total variable with an initial value of 0.

Note: You can pass a string prompt to int(input()).

Next, use a for loop and range() function to calculate the total of the squares of all integers from 1 to that number.

Last, print the output as an integer value.
