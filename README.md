# Codedex Python Course repo #

This repository is made for myself to learn and understand **Python** better.
I am using this website: https://www.codedex.io/python for this reason.
Below I will explain what tasks and exercises I have done.

----

## Chapter 1 ##

### 01. Setting up ###

Copying and pasting a single line of code that prints a message. Making sure
that when the code runs, the message appears on our terminal.

### 02. Hello World ###

Same as the exercise above, but the different message is being displayed.

### 03. Pattern ###

Creating a simple triangle pattern made with numbers and spaces. Multiple
print() methods required.

### 04. Initials ###

Displaying our initials with block letters. A single line comment has been added
to say a fun fact about the person holding those initials.

### 05. Snail Mail ###

A small letter with multiple print methods that says our goal after completing this course.
