# Codedex Python Course repo #

This repository is made for myself to learn and understand **Python** better.
I am using this website: https://www.codedex.io/python for this reason.
Below I will explain what tasks and exercises I have done.

----

## Chapter 1 ##

### 01. Setting up ###

Copying and pasting a single line of code that prints a message. Making sure
that when the code runs, the message appears on our terminal.

### 02. Hello World ###

Same as the exercise above, but the different message is being displayed.

### 03. Pattern ###

Creating a simple triangle pattern made with numbers and spaces. Multiple
print() methods required.

### 04. Initials ###

Displaying our initials with block letters. A single line comment has been added
to say a fun fact about the person holding those initials.

### 05. Snail Mail ###

A small letter with multiple print methods that says our goal after completing this course.

## Chapter 2 ##

### 06. Data types ###

Initializing 4 variables, each one with a different data type. Below I present the data
types I used:

- **String**
- **Integer**
- **Float**
- **Boolean**

### 07. Temperature ###

Simple temperature converter. The program converts the assigned temperature value from
Fahrenheit to Celcius (based on the formula for this purpose). After this, the result
is being printed out.

### 08. BMI ###

Similar to the previous example, I assigned both values (weight and height) by myself.
Based on those values, the program calculates the user's BMI. The body mass index (BMI) was created by a Belgian mathematician in the 1850s and it's used by health and nutrition professionals to quickly estimate body fat in certain populations. The formula is pretty simple: Take an individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing it by their height in meters, squared.

### 09. Pythagorean Theorem ###

A **Pythagorean Theorem**  is the relationship between the three sides of a right triangle. It was named after the Greek philosopher Pythagoras, born around 570 BC. The program for this takes 3 values:

- The **a** which is the length of a short side.
- The **b** which is the length of another short side.
- The **c** which is the length of the hypotenuse.

The hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangle. Program asks  the user for two numbers, a and b, and then calculates the hypotenuse c.

### 10. Currency ###

We just got home from a fun trip to South America, specifically Colombia, Peru, and Brazil. There's some leftover cash in:

- Colombian pesos
- Peruvian soles
- Brazilian reais

A program asks the user for the amount they have in pesos, soles, and reais and calculates the total in USD.
